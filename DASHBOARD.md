# Dashboard Landing Page for Authenticated Users

## Overview
A comprehensive dashboard landing page has been created for users who log in to the Flag Football Directory platform.

## What's New

### 1. Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
Located at `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, this page provides authenticated users with:

#### Features:
- **Personalized Welcome**: Greets users by their first name
- **Quick Action Cards**: Fast access to add programs (leagues, teams, tournaments, clinics)
- **Overview Stats**: Displays user statistics including:
  - Active listings count
  - Pending submissions
  - Total submissions
  - Views (coming soon)
- **Recent Submissions**: Shows the last 5 submissions with status indicators
- **Browse Directory**: Quick links to different sections of the platform

#### Security:
- Automatically redirects non-authenticated users to `/login`
- Shows loading state while checking authentication
- Protected route using the `useAuth` hook

### 2. Updated Login Flow
The login page now redirects users to `/dashboard` instead of `/adult`:
- After successful sign-in
- After successful sign-up (with active session)
- When already logged in

### 3. Enhanced Navbar
The navigation bar now includes:
- **Dashboard Link**: Visible only to authenticated users
  - Shows active state when on the dashboard page
  - Available in both desktop and mobile views
- Positioned between the main navigation and user info

### 4. Layout Updates
- Root layout simplified to give pages more control over their styling
- Dashboard has its own layout that integrates seamlessly with the global navigation
- Footer remains consistent across all pages

## User Flow

```
1. User visits /login
2. User signs in or creates account
3. Redirected to /dashboard
4. User sees personalized dashboard with:
   - Quick actions to add programs
   - Overview of their submissions
   - Easy navigation to browse directory
5. Can return to dashboard anytime via Navbar
```

## Technical Details

### Authentication
Uses the existing `AuthProvider` context from `/components/AuthProvider.tsx`
- Supabase authentication
- Session management
- Sign out functionality

### Data Fetching
Fetches user submissions from the `submissions` table:
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('submissions')
  .select('*')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(5)
```

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Consistent with the existing design system
- Uses the brand colors (#001f3d, #e87a00, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard page
