## API Integration

The form submits to `/api/submit` using **FormData** (multipart/form-data). The backend should:
1. Accept `free-agent` as a valid type
2. Parse FormData including file uploads
3. Upload photos/videos to storage (e.g., Supabase Storage, AWS S3)
4. Store file URLs in database
5. Return success/error response

### Backend Requirements

- **Parse FormData** instead of JSON
- **Handle file uploads** for photos and videos
- **Store files** in cloud storage
- **Generate URLs** for stored media
- **Validate file types** (images: png/jpg/gif, videos: mp4/mov/avi)
- **Enforce size limits** (photos: 10MB, videos: 50MB)

### Suggested Database Table Structure

```sql
create table free_agents (
  id bigserial primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id),
  first_name text not null,
  last_name text not null,
  email text not null,
  phone text,
  instagram text,  -- NEW
  city text not null,
  state text not null,
  age_category text not null,
  age int,
  gender text not null,
  position text,
  skill_level text not null,
  experience text,
  availability text[],
  looking_for text[],
  travel_distance text,
  bio text,
  photo_urls text[],  -- NEW: Array of photo URLs
  video_urls text[],  -- NEW: Array of video URLs
  status text default 'active',
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

### Example File Storage with Supabase

```typescript
// Backend code example
const { data: photoUpload, error: photoError } = await supabase.storage
  .from('free-agent-media')
  .upload(`${userId}/photos/${Date.now()}_${file.name}`, file)

const photoUrl = supabase.storage
  .from('free-agent-media')
  .getPublicUrl(photoUpload.path).data.publicUrl
```

## Summary

The Free Agent feature completes the platform by allowing individual players to make themselves discoverable. This creates a true marketplace where programs find players AND players find programs, significantly increasing the value proposition for both sides of the network! üéØ‚ö°
