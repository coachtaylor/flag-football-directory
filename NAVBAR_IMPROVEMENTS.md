# Navbar Reorganization - User Experience Improvements

## Problem
The navbar was cluttered and crowded, especially when users were logged in, with too many separate elements competing for attention.

## Before (Logged In - Desktop)
```
[Logo] [Adult ▼] [Youth ▼] | [Add Program] [Dashboard] [Hi, John] [Sign Out]
                              ↑ 4 separate items on the right side
```

## After (Logged In - Desktop)
```
[Logo] [Adult ▼] [Youth ▼] | [Add Program] [John D. ▼]
                              ↑ 2 consolidated items
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Consolidated User Menu** 
- **Before**: 3 separate items (Dashboard link + User greeting + Sign Out button)
- **After**: 1 elegant dropdown menu containing:
  - User name with icon
  - Dashboard (with active state)
  - Sign Out

### 2. **Prominent Call-to-Action**
- **Before**: Dark blue "Add Program" button that blended with Sign Out
- **After**: Bold orange "Add Program" button that stands out as the primary action
  - Changed from `bg-[#001f3d]` to `bg-[#e87a00]`
  - More visually prominent and encourages user engagement

### 3. **Cleaner Visual Hierarchy**
- Logo and navigation on left
- Primary action (Add Program) stands out
- User menu elegantly tucked on right
- Less cognitive load for users

### 4. **Improved Mobile Experience**
- **Before**: Stacked buttons with Dashboard at top
- **After**: 
  - "Add Program" as primary CTA at top
  - Account section clearly separated with label
  - Dashboard and Sign Out grouped logically

### 5. **Better Interaction Patterns**
- User menu dropdown works with hover (desktop) for quick access
- Matches the Adult/Youth dropdown interaction pattern
- Consistent behavior across all dropdown menus

## Visual Design Changes

### Desktop Navigation
- **User Menu Button**: Clean white background with border, hover effect changes to orange
- **Add Program Button**: Now uses brand orange (#e87a00) instead of dark blue
- **Dropdown Menu**: Right-aligned, appears below user button with smooth animation
- **Sign Out**: Red hover state to indicate destructive action

### Mobile Navigation  
- **Section Separator**: "Account" label clearly separates navigation from account actions
- **Button Hierarchy**: 
  1. Add Program (orange, prominent)
  2. Account section with Dashboard & Sign Out (subtle, organized)
- **Login**: Remains prominent for non-authenticated users

## Technical Implementation

### New Components
- `UserIcon`: SVG icon for user profile
- User dropdown menu with proper ARIA attributes

### State Management
- User menu integrated into existing `desktopMenuOpen` state
- Properly closes on outside clicks and Escape key
- Ref tracking for click-outside detection

### Accessibility
- Proper `aria-label`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded` attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management

## User Benefits

1. **Less Overwhelming**: Reduced visual clutter makes navigation easier
2. **Clearer Actions**: Primary CTA (Add Program) is now unmissable
3. **Logical Grouping**: User-related actions consolidated in one place
4. **Professional Feel**: Matches modern web app patterns (Notion, Linear, etc.)
5. **Faster Navigation**: Hover-to-open dropdown provides quick access

## Before & After Item Count

### Desktop (Logged In)
- **Before**: 7 items (Logo + 2 nav + Add Program + Dashboard + Greeting + Sign Out)
- **After**: 5 items (Logo + 2 nav + Add Program + User Menu)
- **Reduction**: 29% fewer visual elements

### Desktop (Logged Out)
- **Before**: 4 items (Logo + 2 nav + Add Program + Login)
- **After**: 4 items (Logo + 2 nav + Add Program + Login)
- **No change**, but better visual balance

## Responsive Behavior
- Mobile: Hamburger menu maintains all functionality
- Tablet: Switches to mobile menu at `md` breakpoint
- Desktop: Clean, professional layout with dropdowns
